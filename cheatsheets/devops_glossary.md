# DevOps Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for common DevOps terminology used throughout the days and cheatsheets.

## A

**Agile**: A software development methodology that emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility.

**Artifact**: A file or package produced during the build process that is intended for deployment.

**AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: A cloud computing platform offering a wide range of services.

**Azure**: Microsoft's cloud computing platform.

## B

**Blue-Green Deployment**: A deployment strategy that maintains two identical production environments, with only one active at a time.

**Branching Strategy**: A set of rules that define how and when branches should be created, merged, and deleted in version control.

**Build**: The process of converting source code into a standalone artifact.

## C

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**: Practices that automate the integration and deployment of code changes.

**Cloud Native**: Applications designed specifically to leverage cloud computing architectures.

**Containerization**: The process of packaging an application and its dependencies into a container.

**Configuration Management**: The process of systematically handling changes to a system's configuration.

## D

**Deployment**: The process of releasing software to a production environment.

**DevOps**: A set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle.

**Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

**Drift**: When the actual state of infrastructure differs from the defined state.

## E

**Environment**: A specific setup where an application runs (e.g., development, staging, production).

**Ephemeral Infrastructure**: Infrastructure that is temporarily created and then destroyed when no longer needed.

## F

**Feature Flag**: A technique that allows features to be enabled or disabled at runtime.

**Feedback Loop**: The process of using output information to improve input in an iterative cycle.

## G

**Git**: A distributed version control system.

**GCP (Google Cloud Platform)**: Google's cloud computing platform.

## H

**High Availability (HA)**: System design that ensures a certain level of operational performance, usually uptime, for a higher than normal period.

**Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more machines to a system to handle increased load.

## I

**IaC (Infrastructure as Code)**: Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes.

**Idempotent**: An operation that produces the same result regardless of how many times it is performed.

**Immutable Infrastructure**: Infrastructure that cannot be modified after deployment; changes require new deployments.

## J

**Jenkins**: An open-source automation server used for CI/CD.

## K

**Kubernetes**: An open-source container orchestration platform.

**Key Performance Indicator (KPI)**: A measurable value that demonstrates how effectively objectives are being achieved.

## L

**Load Balancing**: Distributing network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.

**Logging**: Recording events that occur in a system.

## M

**Microservices**: An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

**Monitoring**: Observing and checking the progress or quality of something over time.

**Multi-tenancy**: A software architecture where a single instance serves multiple customers (tenants).

## N

**Node**: A physical or virtual machine in a network.

**Non-functional Requirements**: Requirements that specify criteria for judging the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors.

## O

**Orchestration**: Automated configuration, coordination, and management of computer systems and software.

**On-call**: A rotation where team members are available to respond to incidents outside regular working hours.

## P

**Pipeline**: A set of automated processes that allow developers to reliably and efficiently compile, build, and deploy their code.

**Provisioning**: The process of setting up IT infrastructure.

**Pull Request**: A method of submitting contributions to a project.

## Q

**Quality Assurance (QA)**: Activities focused on ensuring that implemented processes are appropriate and effective.

**Queue**: A line of items waiting to be processed.

## R

**Rollback**: Reverting to a previous version of software or configuration.

**Runbook**: A compilation of procedures and operations that are performed by system administrators or operators.

## S

**Scaling**: The ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources.

**Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: A commitment between a service provider and a client about aspects of the service.

**Serverless**: A cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure.

## T

**Terraform**: An open-source IaC tool.

**Testing**: The process of evaluating a system to find defects or verify functionality.

**Throughput**: The amount of work a system can handle in a given time period.

## U

**Uptime**: The time during which a system is operational.

**User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Testing performed by the end user to verify the system meets their requirements.

## V

**Vertical Scaling**: Adding more resources (CPU, RAM) to a single machine to handle increased load.

**Version Control**: A system that records changes to files over time.

**Virtual Machine (VM)**: An emulation of a computer system.

## W

**Webhook**: A method for augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page or application with custom callbacks.

**Workflow**: A sequence of processes through which a piece of work passes from initiation to completion.

## X

**X as Code**: The practice of managing various aspects of IT through code (e.g., Infrastructure as Code, Security as Code).

## Y

**YAML**: A human-readable data serialization standard often used in configuration files.

## Z

**Zero Downtime Deployment**: A deployment strategy that ensures the application remains available during the deployment process.

**Zero Trust**: A security concept centered on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters.
